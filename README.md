An R-Package that facilitates simulation studies

The *simTool* package is designed for statistical simulations that
have two components. One component generates the data and the other one
analyzes the data. The main aims of the *simTool* package are the reduction
of the administrative source code (mainly loops) and a simple applicability
of the package that allows the user to quickly learn how to work with the
simTool package. Parallel computing is also supported. Finally, convenient
functions are provided to summarize the simulation results.
