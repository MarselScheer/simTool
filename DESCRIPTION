Description: The simTool package is designed for statistical simulations that
    have two components. One component generates the data and the other one
    analyzes the data. The main aims of the simTool package are the reduction
    of the administrative source code (mainly loops) and a simple applicability
    of the package that allows the user to quickly learn how to work with the
    simTool package. Parallel computing is also supported. Finally, convenient
    functions are provided to summarize the simulation results.
